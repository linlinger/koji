## 简介

```
Koji is an RPM-based build system. The Fedora Project uses Koji for their build system, as do several other projects.

Koji's goal is to provide a flexible, secure, and reproducible way to build software.
```

* New buildroot for each build
* Robust XML-RPC APIs for easy integration with other tools
* Web interface with SSL and Kerberos authentication
* Thin, portable command line client
* Users can create local buildroots
* Buildroot contents are tracked in the database
* Versioned data
